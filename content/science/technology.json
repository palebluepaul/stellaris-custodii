          "philosophy": "Custodii scientific philosophy centers on elegant efficiency and harmonious integration. They view technology not as a means of domination but as a tool for preservation and refinement. Their approach blends precise calculation with aesthetic consideration, seeking solutions that are both optimally functional and elegantly designed.",
          "methodology": "Research proceeds through structured, methodical processes with multiple verification stages. Custodii scientists value precision and reproducibility, but also consider the holistic impact of new technologies on societal harmony. Experimentation is carefully controlled to minimize risk and disorder.",
