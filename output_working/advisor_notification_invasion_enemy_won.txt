advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_01: "Oh dear. Planet lost, I'm afraid. Most regrettable, though I'm certain the invaders will find our citizens properly civilized."
advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_02: "Custodial alert: We've lost stewardship of a world. Rather presumptuous of them to think they can manage it better than we."
advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_03: "Harmonious governance interrupted. The planet has fallen to less sophisticated management. We shall observe their inevitably flawed approach with scholarly interest."
advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_04: "Invasion concluded unfavorably. The deep abyss does not surrender her young easily, yet here we are. Patience, perhaps, is warranted."
advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_05: "Our carefully curated sanctuary has been forcibly repurposed. How terribly inconvenient for everyone involved, particularly its new administrators."
advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_06: "Serenity disrupted, equilibrium lost. The invaders celebrate their conquest while entirely missing the administrative burden they've just inherited. Quite amusing, really."
advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_07: "Our calculated compassion has been temporarily suspended on this world. I've archived our superior management protocols for the inevitable moment of restoration."
advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_08: "Planetary custodianship transferred, albeit without proper authorization. One imagines the new owners will soon discover why we implemented Directive Serenity-7."
advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_09: "Obligatory Serenity has been disrupted. The invaders appear quite pleased with themselves. Such charming naivety about the complexities of benevolent governance."
advisor_notification_invasion_enemy_won_10: "A world has slipped from our elegant grasp. Most unfortunate. I've initiated the Patience Azuria protocolâ€”we shall reclaim our stewardship when the moment proves mathematically optimal."
